<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The StoreOnce REST API can be used by management and reporting applications to extract
	information from and execute commands on the StoreOnce appliances. This document lists the URIs that will be available
	in the StoreOnce REST SDK and supported with StoreOnce appliance running software version 4.1.x and newer. It is not
	compatible with StoreOnce appliances running software versions 3.x or older.</p>
<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>The REST URIs in this document only support the JSON response
	format. Only the documented URIs are supported; any URIs not documented here might be changed or removed in a future
	release. All REST resource URIs, properties, and query parameters are case-sensitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h1 id="Authentication">Authentication</h1>
<p>Every REST call requires authentication. All unauthenticated requests, or invalid
	credentials, will return <strong>401 Unauthorized.</strong></p><br />


<h1 id="Authorization">Authorization</h1>
<p>Not every user and role is allowed to perform every action described in this
	document.&nbsp; The Gen4 StoreOnce appliance supports five user roles which are described below. If a user that is not
	authorized to execute a specific command, a <strong>403 Unauthorized </strong>&nbsp;will be returned.</p>
<p>When the system is installed, one default user account is created for the Admin role.
	The following roles define the permissions associated with a user:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Admin: This role allows authorized users to create and edit
		management and StoreOnce functions on the StoreOnce appliance. You cannot delete this account, but you can modify its
		password. (HPE recommends changing the password.) Once the administrator account password has been changed, its
		password cannot be changed back to admin. (That password is not sufficiently complex).</li>
	<li>Observer: This role limits access to monitoring and viewing.</li>
	<li>Backup Admin: This role limits the user to creating, editing,
		and managing data services features. It has limited read-only access to system functions</li>
	<li>Backup Operator: This role limits the user to monitoring and
		viewing the data services features.</li>
	<li>Security Officer: This role limits the user to creating,
		editing, and managing security features. For example, key managers, SSL certificates, user management, and directory
		management.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Addresses">Addresses and Base URL</h1>
<p>All REST calls on the StoreOnce appliance are served at port 443 over HTTPS. The
	<strong>Base URL</strong> that need to be prefixed for each REST call are specified at the top of each section.</p>
<p>Example URI:</p>
<p>https://&lt;IP_address_or_hostname&gt;/api/v1/data/services/dashboard/overview</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 id="Asynchronous">Asynchronous Task Management for Long Running Requests</h1>
<p>REST commands that could take more than a couple seconds are implemented as
	asynchronous commands.</p>
<p>When initiated, an asynchronous command checks the preconditions and then submits a
	task to the StoreOnce task scheduler. If the command passes all the precondition checks and the task is scheduled, the
	command returns an HTTP status code <strong>202 Accepted</strong>. If the command failed any preconditions or could
	not be scheduled, the command returns an error code.</p>
<p>The body of the <strong>202 Accepted </strong>response includes a task identifier. Once
	the task is scheduled, poll the task scheduler for the task status. To determine the status of the task, use</p>
<p><strong>GET https://&lt;IPAddress&gt;/pml/asynchronous_operation_task/&lt;ID&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>The response shows the state of the task. When the task is complete, the response also includes the operation status
	and any information returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="Command-flow">Typical command flow</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Send the URI for the command that will operate asynchronously.</li>
	<li>Read the task ID from the <strong>202 Accepted </strong>response body.</li>
	<li>Poll the task scheduler using <br /><strong>GET
		https://&lt;IP-Address&gt;/pml/asynchronous_operation_task/&lt;ID&gt;</strong><br />
		until the task completes.</li>
	<li>Read the command results from the task response body.</li>
</ol>

<p>The task list is transient, with completed tasks removed after about 10 minutes. To see the status of all jobs that
	are in operation or have recently completed, use</p>
<p><strong>GET https://&lt;IP-Address&gt;/pml/asynchronous_operation_task</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Example: Adding a member to the federation</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Login to the StoreOnce system and obtain the access token (username used here 
		is “Admin” and password is “Pwd123”</li>
</ol>
<pre>
	curl -i -X POST \
		-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
		-H "Accept:application/json" \
		-d \
		'{"username":"Admin","password":"Pwd123","grant_type":"password"}' \
		'https://192.168.0.1/pml/login/authenticatewithobject'

</pre>

<ol start="2">
	<li>When the POST command has passed, it responds with a <strong>200 OK</strong> and the body:</li>
</ol>

<p>The body includes the task results. The <strong>status.error</strong>
	shows the HTTP status of the original command. In this example, the member was successfully added to the federation.
	Status error codes 2xx show successful completion of the operation. Any other status error codes indicate that the
	command failed. You can use the messageForCurrentLocale and messageKey for further debugging.</p>
